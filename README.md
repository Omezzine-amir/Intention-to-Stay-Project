# Intention-to-Stay-Project

In the "Intention to Stay Project Report" by Amir Omezzine (March 2024), the study aims to explore the factors influencing employees' intention to stay at a global firm using a dataset of 976 employees. Utilizing STATA and SPSS for analysis, the project investigates the impact of salary, perceived recognition by management, attachment to the company, and seniority on the intention to stay. The regression analysis approach was chosen to assess direct, mediated, and moderated effects within the conceptual framework. Key tools included are:

STATA and SPSS: For detailed statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.
Regression Analysis: To explore the direct and indirect influences of salary, perceived recognition, attachment to the company, and seniority on the intention to stay.
Descriptive Statistics and Data Handling: For initial data familiarization and handling of missing values through listwise deletion based on the assumption that missingness was completely at random.
Moderation and Mediation Models: To understand how seniority alters the impact of perceived recognition and attachment on the intention to stay.
OLS Assumptions Testing: Including tests for homoscedasticity, multicollinearity, and normality of residuals to ensure the robustness of regression results.
Model Improvement Measures: Including the use of robust standard errors and mean-centering to address heteroscedasticity and multicollinearity, respectively.
The study found that salary, attachment to the company, and seniority have significant positive effects on employees' intention to stay, while perceived recognition did not show a significant direct effect. Additionally, seniority moderated the effects of perceived recognition and attachment on the intention to stay, indicating that these influences vary with employee seniority levels. The comprehensive regression model explained approximately 65.31% of the variance in employees' intention to stay, highlighting the substantial impact of these factors on employee retention decisions.
